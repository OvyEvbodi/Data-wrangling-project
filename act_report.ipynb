    "The [\"WeRateDogs\"](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) page features hundreds of dog breeds in their posts, but we all know they do not own the dogs that they post and rate. With this insight, I wanted to find out the 10 most common dogs that get featured on their Twitter page. Luckily for me, I worked with an image predictions dataset that made my analysis a whole lot easier. The dataset provided me with the breed predictions of each dog post, which facilitated the extraction of the 10 most common dog breeds on their twitter page as at August 1st, 2017."

    "Most of their posts are dog posts, or I would think that at least 90% of them are, considering that their user name literlly has the word \"dog\" in it. With this final insight, I wanted to find out the percentage of their posts as at August 1st, 2017, that was about dogs. The machine learning model dataset that I worked with already had a section that stated whether the predictions were dog predictions or not. I calculated the percentage of dog posts using the number of dog predictions, dividing it by the total number of posts that I worked with, and multiplying the result by 100. I could infer that based on the data that I worked with, about 84.47% of their posts were dog posts. So close to my guess!"
