## A simple product landing page
#### by Ovy Evbodi


###Introduction

"WeRateDogs" is a Twitter page that rates cute animals, mostly dogs, on Twitter. They post, and repost, thousands of cute dogs on their page, and rate them using a very unique rating system that has gotten them millions of followers over the years, now with over 4 million followers, they have gained international recognition.

I carried out a simple analysis of some of their tweets from 2015 to 2017 to generate some insights and share them here. In this report, I'll be communicating the 3 insights that I produced, which are listed below:

10 most common dog breeds

Which dog stage had the highest numbers of likes and retweets

How many dog predictions were truly dogs based on a machine learning model
