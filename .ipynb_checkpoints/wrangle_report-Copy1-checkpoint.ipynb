I queried the Twitter API to get the number of retweets and favourites for each tweet in the Twitter archives DataFrame using the Twitter id as the identifier, I then saved the results into a text file which I read into a third pandas DataFrame. <hr>"

To achieve this, I used the the pandas 'melt' method to join the dog stages columns which were 4 in total. I named the new, single column 'dog_stages', but realised that the method of entry of the values was repetitive in the sense that each row had 4 different values for the dog stage, as opposed to having only one value and 3 null columns per record. To combat this issue, I coverted the 'none' string values to 'NaN' datatype which made the melt method efficient."
